# Energy Availability Planners Platform

Welcome to our «Energy Availability Planners Platform» ENAPP, an initiative of the «Swiss Energy Data Working Group»!

We aim to make current and future availabilities of energy transparent to all affected stakeholders.

Stay tuned for more information to come!

## Availability Data

Communitcationg energy availability is based on a few data sets:

- **Providers** - providers of electricity (or other forms of energy such as gas) define **regions** which can be turned off and on. See [list of providers of electrical energy](https://www.strom.ch/de/service/verzeichnis-verteilnetzbetreiber).
- **Regions** - service ares as defined by providers. Regions can be independently turned off and on (such as a transformer area). Regions provide enerty to a number of **buildings**.
- **Availability plans** - these plans are defined by providers and specify periods with off and on dates and times. Availability plans are applied to regions.
- **Persons** - individuals who are reliablay registered with the platform. These individuals are entitled to obtain energy availability information for a limited number of building addresses (typically their own and a few relatives).

Availability data is specified in detail in the [ENAPP schema](schema/enapp-schema.pdf).
